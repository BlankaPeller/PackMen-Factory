# PackMen Factory


## Description

This is a small project completed by me during the MIT JavaScript Coding Bootcamp. This exercise is mainly based on JavaScript to create a so called "Packmen Factory". In this project, you can either create more Packmen or start the game. Once the game is started, the Packmen will fly around the screen at different velocities and will bounce off the edge of the screen. 

## Usage

To download, click the "Fork" button on the top right corner to clone the repository. When done, open the folder in which the files are stored, and open the index.html file in your browser. Press the "Add Packmen" button in the upper left corner to add more Packmen to the screen, or press "Start Game" to let the PackMen start flying about!

## Roadmap

This project could become a fun game in the future. It could be turned into a Space Invaders type of game, where you have to shoot all the Packmen before they hit you, with different difficulty modes you could complete.
